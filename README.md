# PropFlow 🏠
### PG Property Management System

> One platform for Owners, Tenants, and Workers — manage everything from rent to repairs, without WhatsApp chaos.

🔴 **Live Demo:** [https://demo-ofi9.onrender.com](https://demo-ofi9.onrender.com)

## The Problem It Solves

Managing a PG property today means:
- Rent reminders scattered across WhatsApp
- No record of who paid and who didn't
- Maintenance workers with no task tracking
- Vacate requests lost in chat threads
- Owners with no clear view across multiple properties

**PropFlow replaces all of that with one organized system.**

---

## Who Uses It

| Role | What They Can Do |
|------|-----------------|
| 🏢 **Owner** | Add properties, assign tenants, view payment ledger, get alerts, manage vacate requests |
| 🧑 **Tenant** | View rent due, make payment entries, chat with owner, submit vacate form |
| 🔧 **Worker** | Receive maintenance tasks, update job status, view assigned property |

---

## Features

### 💰 Payment Ledger
